# Scarborough Fair

Are you going to Scarborough Fair?

问尔所之，是否如适

Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme

蕙兰芫荽，郁郁香芷

Remember me to one who lives there

彼方淑女，凭君寄辞

She once was a true love of mine

伊人曾在，与我相知

 

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt

嘱彼佳人，备我衣缁

Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme

蕙兰芫荽，郁郁香芷

Without no seams nor need work

勿用针剪，无隙无疵

Then she'll be a true love of mine

伊人何在，慰我相思

 

Tell her to find me on acre of land

嘱彼佳人，营我家室

Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme

蕙兰芫荽，郁郁香芷

Between the salt water and the sea strand

良田所修，大海之坻

Then she'll be a true love of mine

伊人应在，任我相视

 

Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather

嘱彼佳人，收我秋实

Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme

蕙兰芫荽，郁郁香芷

And gather it all in a bunch of heather

敛之集之，勿弃勿失

Then she'll be a true love of mine

伊人犹在，唯我相誓

 

Are you going to Scarborough Fair?

彼方淑女，凭君寄辞
