The walk round Royal Botanic Garden is lovely! There are so many great views too of the Opera House, skyline and there are many shops/restaurants near by to stop during the journey. I would definitely recommend adding this to list while visiting Sydney!

I was on my own so this was handy to walk round, having gone down to see the Opera House. There are better views of the opera house if you follow the paths through the botanical gardens. I especially liked the succulent garden.

You couldn’t find a better city Botanic Gardens if you tried in my opinion. The Royal Botanic Gardens hug the harbour with fabulous water views in one direction over Farm Cove and out to Fort Denison and back to the skyline inc Centrepoint tower in the other. They’re also right next to the iconic Sydney Opera house and perfectly located for a walk after the theatre (I had a stroll after seeing ‘West Side Story’).

The Gardens do tours, have special events, and much more. I walked past not one bit two wedding parties. There the Botanic Garden Cafe which does a great cuppa. Over 30 acres there is a fantastic variety of trees and plants as well as sculptures, ponds (full of eels!), gazebos and flower exhibits etc.

Knock yourself out, these Gardens are great!

When you are tired of city walking, just cross a street and find peace and beauty. Colorful, green, wide open lawns, a gorgeous bay with boats, rose garden, herb, flower gardens, cute painted koala bears throughout the garden, unimaginable beauty there, benches to rest and reflect on your travels. We were there just before Halloween thus the vampire Koala

The gardens are beautiful and a great place to sit and eat your lunch in serenity while drinking in the magnificent views of the harbour, bridge and plants. The herb garden and glass houses are a must and the various sculptures add to the atmosphere of the place. It's an enjoyable walk around the various gardens and don't miss the japanese garden, ferns, old trees and ponds. A fantastic place to re-charge your spirit. I just love spending time in the gardens - it is beautiful, cheap and there are always flowers in bloom whatever time of year you visit.

The Royal Botanic Gardens are a tranquil and idyllic spot in central Sydney. They are a great place to unwind and/or start a walk towards the Opera House and The Rocks. The NSW Art Gallery is around the corner too.
